================
Toga quick start
================

Create a new virtual environment. In your virtual environment, install Toga, and
then run it:

.. code-block:: console

  $ python -m pip install toga-demo
  $ toga-demo

This will pop up a GUI window showing the full range of widgets available
to an application using Toga.

.. note::

  Users of `uv` on MacOS who do a uv workspace install `uv add toga-demo` will need to instead run `uv pip install toga-demo` to install the toga demo app. This is due to an `issue <https://github.com/beeware/beeware/issues/451>`_.
